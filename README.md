# Get tDAI on Sepolia while you sleep
 
Had to find an easier way to get tDAI to use on PulseChain Testnet v4 PulseX AMM.
Freeing my time from using the smart contract manually with MetaMask.

NOte: You'll need Sepolia ETH, you can get that from https://sepoliafaucet.com/ make an account, do not use your personal email and use a new wallet address. `when you are done with testing return the ETH and the tDAI so that other people can use them`.
